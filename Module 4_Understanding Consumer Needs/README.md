Sub-Task 1:

We now need to evaluate whether the new option would be attractive to customers. Brainstorm and shortlist criteria that customers may use to evaluate competing offers. What data points would help us decide if the new offer is attractive to consumers? 

Sub-Task 2:

Your team has now collected data via online surveys with consumers. Given the data your team gathered, fill in your evaluation matrix and identify the target segment for this plan.  

Sub-Task 3:

Given the target segment, identify changes to the offering that would make it more attractive for them. Also come up with a product name that you think will appeal to the segment.
