Part A:

Analyse the data from Company A and Company B to determine the impact of leasing handsets on financial performance. State and apply your own assumptions, and identify the metrics you would use to perform a financial forecast for Company X.

Part B:

Apply the metrics and performance impacts you have identified to forecast the upside in terms of the key metrics for Company X. To do this, first assume that Company X will grow at industry average, then assume it will grow at the same rate as Company A, which introduced leasing. Comparing the two forecasts will allow you to calculate the net impact of leasing.
